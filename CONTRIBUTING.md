### `package.json` structure

The structure of the `package.json` file in this project should adhere to a specific format, as illustrated by the example structure below. This structure is based on the [npm documentation for creating a `package.json` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file).

```json
{
	"name": "@repo/example",
	"version": "0.0.1",
	"description": "Description of the package",
	"private": true,
	"scripts": {
		"build": "shx rm -rf dist && ../../scripts/cli.sh bundle",
		"start:dev": "tsc -w",
		"lint": "eslint --ext .js,.ts src/",
		"clean": "shx rm -rf dist && shx rm -rf node_modules && shx rm -rf .turbo",
		"install:clean": "pnpm run clean && pnpm install",
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
		"update:latest": "pnpm update --latest"
	},
	// "type": "module",
	// "source": "./src/index.ts",
	// "main": "./dist/cjs/index.js",
	// "module": "./dist/esm/index.js",
	// "types": "./dist/types/index.d.ts",
	"repository": {

	"peerDependencies": {

	},
	"devDependencies": {

	},
	"files": ["dist", "README.md"]
}
```

	"source": "./src/index.ts", // Entry file (source code)
	"main": "./dist/cjs/index.js", // Entry point (CommonJS)

	"types": "./dist/types/index.d.ts", // Type definitions
